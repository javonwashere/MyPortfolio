  bio: [
    `My name is Dominique L. Duncan. Born in Michigan and raised pretty much everywhere, I spend a lot of my time itching to create something new. Whether it's programming, making logos in Adobe Illustrator, or dabbling in 3D Design... you will always find me building cool stuff on my computer. I started my tech journey in 2018 and I've been passionate about it ever since. Armed with a B.S. in Biology from Northern Illinois University, and now a second B.S. in Computer Science from Auburn, I am excited to add more skills to my toolbelt. When I'm not clacking away on a keyboard, I also enjoy portrait photography. My main interests lie in Web Design, UI/UX Design and Front-End Development. I would also like to become skilled in Mobile Application Development. I am eager to be part of a collaborative experience and grow into my full potential as a Developer.`,

  whatIKnow: [
    `I am strongest in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Although , as you will notice in my projects, I try to get a feel for a variety of tools and languages for well rounded experience and education.`,
    `In my coursework I have coded fully functioning projects in Java, C# and Swift. I enjoy the challenge of learning new languages and workflows.
    I have very basic experience with Python and I am familiar with MySQL.
    I have little experience with JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue. But I am hoping to get on the job experience and mentorship to fully learn these technologies and contribute to meaningful projects.`,
    `I am also skilled at creating designs and publications with Adobe Creative Suite.`,
